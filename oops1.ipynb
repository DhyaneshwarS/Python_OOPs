    "# __Python OOPs Concepts__\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a object-oriented programming language, which means everything in python is treated as object. The approach of solving a programming problem or coding a program by structuring a programs so that the properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "This creating of objects is know as Object Oriented Programming. This fundamental concept of objects makes the code easier to manage and organize.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object has two characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attributes - Data in the form of properties\n",
    "- Behavior - in the form of methods (actions object can perform) \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A parrot is can be an object, as it has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- name, age, color as attributes\n",
    "- singing, dancing as behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the concept of OOP follows some basic principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "###  __Class__\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, everything is an object. To create a object we require a model or blueprint which is nothing but class. We create a class to create a object. A class is like an object constructor or blueprint for creating a objects. The class defines attributes and the behavior of the object, while the object, on the other hand, represents the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Class represents the properties (attribute) and action (behavior) of the object. Properties represent variables, and actions are represented by the methods. Hence class contains both variables and methods.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Classname:\n",
    "    '''documentation string'''\n",
    "    class_suite\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Documentation string: represent a description of the class. It is optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "- class_suite: class suite contains component statements, variables, methods, functions, attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __class__ keyword define a class. From Class we construct instance. An instance is specific object created from a particular class."

    "This is because, whenever an object calls its method, the object itself is passed as the first argument. So, __Tony.add()__ translates into __Customer.add(Tony)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, calling a method with a list of n arguments is equivalent to calling the corresponding function with an argument list that is created by inserting the method's object before the first argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, the first argument of the function in class must be the object itself. This is conventionally called self. It can be named otherwise but we highly recommend to follow the convention."

    "\n",
    "Once you have a class to work with, then you can start creating new instances or objects of that class, which is an efficient way to reuse functionality in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating and initializing objects of a given class is a fundamental step in object-oriented programming. This step is often referred to as object construction or __instantiation__. The tool responsible for running this instantiation process is commonly known as a __class constructor__.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class without a constructor is not really useful in real applications. A constructor is a special type of method used in Python to initialize the object of a Class. The constructor will be executed automatically when the object is created. If we create three objects, the constructor is called three times and initialize each object.\n",

    "    A default constructor is a simple constructor method that doesn't accept any arguments except self.\n",
